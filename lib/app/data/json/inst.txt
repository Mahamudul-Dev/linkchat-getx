I have a search screen where I have a search bar & three tabbar named: "Global", "Follower", "linked".
I want, when user write any keywords in search bar & hit enter the display user list from search api global list items in my global tab, followers list items in my follower tab, linked list items in my linked tab.

Every ListTile must have a button. In global tab all list tile have button named "Follow", In followers tab all list tile have button named "Link" & linked tab all list tile have button named "Unlink".

When user click the follow button in a list tile from global tab, then it will hit in an api & if api got success result then the button named will changed to "Withdraw".

When user click the follow button in a list tile from follower tab, then it will hit in an api & if api got success result then the button named will changed to "Withdraw".
